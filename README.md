# Cracking the DevOps Interview Book Code Repository

## Welcome to "Cracking the DevOps Interview"!

This book is designed to be your ultimate guide for navigating the challenging landscape of DevOps interviews. With a focus on practical knowledge and real-world applications, it covers everything from foundational concepts to advanced technologies that are essential for today's DevOps professionals.Many books help people prepare for software coding interviews and system design questions, but there's little for people in DevOps to prepare for their job interviews. That's why I wrote the book Cracking the Coding Interview for DevOps. This book covers the top 100 questions in DevOps interviews, gives you some real projects to practice, and even has a bonus on using ChatGPT for DevOps work. It's a valuable book for nailing job interviews and handling everyday tasks in DevOps jobs. Any feedback on the book will be greatly appreciated. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable to me.
